**Motivation**


## CONCEPT:
This includes 3 games:

### Red light green light:
This game has two team, üëßthe catcher andüèÉthe player.

üü© The player _can only_ run when the catcher said **green light** and face **the back**.

üü• The player cannot move when the catcher said **red light** and face **the front**. 

‚ùå If the player get caught moving when catcher said red light, he lose. You only lose the game not your life in the movie.

‚úÖ The player win if he reach the finish line before time is ran out without get caught.


**Primary Feature(must-have):**
- Fully Functional GUI,
- One bot to catch the player
- A timer to count the time left for each game, and it display on the screen for the player to see
- Player clock to count the difference in time(this is subject to change if we found better method)
- Bots playing with player(10+, but most of them will lose the game)

**Secondary Feature(nice-to-have):**
          
- SFX (Game start, Game-over, Win,...)
- Due to licensing fee, I won't get "Fly me to the moon in the game"
- Multiplayer, possibly in the same wifi, not online.
- Nice Backdrop(2D only)
- Eliminate player animation.
